# power-of-pr
This is a repo that can be used for demonstrating the power of pull requests and code reviews.

1. Create a new branch from main
2. Add functionality to the `didVisit` function in `script.js` to validate that a parameter was provided.
3. Push and open a PR for the new branch to be merged into `main`
